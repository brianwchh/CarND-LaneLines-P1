### 1: 
My pipline 
	a. grayscle image 
	b. crop the bottom half of the image 
	c. do canny edge detection
	d. crop the trangle region of the interest from the image 
	e. do hough line detection 
	f. processing lines and divid them into left and right groups according to their slopes
	g. processing each group of the lines, average the slopes and intersections with the 		bottom line of the image .

### 2: the shortcoming of my pipline 
	a. it is hard to tune a suitable parameters for canny edge detection and hough line transform, in real application, this method is infeasible .


### 3 , possible improvements :
	a. add kalman filter to track the lines . so that the lines would not jump around .
